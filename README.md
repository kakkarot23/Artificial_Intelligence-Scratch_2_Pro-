## 🧩 Tips to make this README *even better*
1. Put this `README.md` in a repo named exactly: `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` to show it on your profile.
2. Generate nice images (radar, project thumbnails) and store them in `assets/` inside the same repo.
3. Use GitHub Actions to update rotating highlights or a dynamic "fun fact" every day (workflow provided below).
4. Add short demo GIFs for each project (host in `assets/` and reference them).
5. Use `<!-- start -->` `<!-- end -->` comment blocks to let an action update parts of the README safely.

If you want, I can:
- generate a matching `ai-skill-radar.png` SVG or PNG,
- create the exact workflow file that auto-updates a “quote / last-updated” block, or
- produce polished project GIFs (instructions & sample commands).

Would you like the auto-update GitHub Action YAML now? (I can include it below and you can paste it into `.github/workflows/`.)
